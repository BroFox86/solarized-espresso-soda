# Espresso Soda Solarized Theme for VSC

Converted theme for Visual Studio Code from 
the original [Soda Theme](https://github.com/buymeasoda/soda-theme) 
using [Yeoman generator](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode-docs/blob/0.9.0/release-notes/latest.md).
I fixed several bugs after convertion as well.  

This theme based on the “Solarized Light” VSC default theme. Also aviable a light version of the theme: [Espresso Soda Light](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=brofox86.theme-espresso-soda-light)
